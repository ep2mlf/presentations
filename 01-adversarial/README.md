# Adversarial neural networks

The provided notebook requires a few python packages. If you are happy
installing these your current python environment, you can run:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt [--user]
```
If you would prefer using a virtual environment, first make sure you have
`virtualenv` installed, then run
```bash
$ source virtualenv.sh
```
This will install the virtual environment `env-01-adversarial` in the current
directory as well as an IPython kernel when can then be used in Jupyter. To use
this virtual environment in the Jupyter Notebook, open the .ipynb file and
select "Kernel > Change Kernel > env-01-adversarial" in the toolbar.
